<p>This chart shows how many comments mention Mickey, Donald or Sonic over 25 months in my Twitch chat. The heroes were chosen based on the games I play. The chart was made with R and dygraphs, the original data was collected with my Python-bot and the CSV-file was created with C#.</p>

<p>Make sure you enlarge the picture! Sonic is the clear winner :(</p>
