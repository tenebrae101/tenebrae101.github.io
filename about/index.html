	<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

		<p>Hello! My name on the internet is Tenebrae but most people I've met in real life know me as Ville Hietala.</p>

		<h2>Education and work</h2>

		<p>I am a BA in East Asian studies, focusing on Korea and Japan. Currently I am finishing my MA on language technology in the University of Helsinki. Since my interests lie in languages in general, my minor subjects &mdash; linguistics, language technology and sociology were chosen to support the study of East Asian languages.</p>
		<p>In addition to Korean, Japanese and basic Chinese, I also have studied several European languages &mdash; Portuguese, Spanish, French and Italian in addition to English, Swedish and my mother tongue Finnish.</p>
		<p>I have also studied information engineering and media technology on university level but dropped these after getting an opportunity to study at a prestigious Finnish university.</p>

		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<p>Computer science is naturally close to the heart and I have at least some knowledge of following languages and technologies:
		<ul>
			<li>HTML&amp;CSS</li>
			<li>JavaScript</li>
			<li>React</li>
			<li>jQuery</li>
			<li>Python</li>
			<li>Databases (SQL, MySQL)</li>
			<li>C#</li>
			<li>R</li>
		</ul></p>

		<p>My <a href="https://github.com/tenebrae101/">>Github profile</a> has some code examples I have done as a hobby. <b>Tenebot</b> is an IRC bot I use every time I stream on Twitch. <b>Sonic 1 AutoSplitter</b> was made for making <a href="https://www.google.fi/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiu_rKAq6fVAhUmb5oKHfuyBToQFggmMAA&url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FSpeedrun&usg=AFQjCNFZWfNu1oacyNOdhrf6RDxtoEXdTg">speedrunning</a> a certain game easier.</p>

		<p>Video game speedrunning &mdash; beating a video game as fast as possible &mdash; is another hobby of mine. I mostly play retro games, especially those on the Sega Mega Drive (Genesis in North America). I stream somewhat regularly <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/tenebrae101/">on my channel.</a>.</p>
